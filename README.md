# Music-Store-Database
This is one of the projects I had to do under Udacity Business Analysis Nanodegree.
In this project, I queried the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. For this project, I assisted the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information.
The music store wants to throw a promotional Music Festival in the city they made the most money. So I queried the database to extract informatiosn like: the  city with best customers, the best customer, the genre of music the customers like the most, the most popular music Genre for each country and the tracks with longest milliseconds.
